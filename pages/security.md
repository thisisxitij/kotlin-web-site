# Kotlin Security

We do our best to make sure our products are free of security vulnerabilities. To reduce the risk of introducing a vulnerability,
you can follow these best practices: 

* Always use the latest Kotlin releases. For security purposes, we sign our releases published on [Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jetbrains/kotlin/) 
with these PGP keys.
* Use the latest versions of your applicationâ€™s dependencies. If you still need to use a specific dependency version, 
periodically check if there are any new security vulnerabilities. You can follow 
[the guidelines from GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies) 
or browse known vulnerabilities in the [CVE base](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html).

We are very eager and grateful to hear about any security issues you find. To report vulnerabilities that you discover in Kotlin,
please post a message directly to our [issue tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT) (setting the issue type to ['Security Problem'](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/KT?q=%23%7BSecurity%20Problem%7D%20)) 
or send us an [email](mailto:security@jetbrains.org). For further information on how our responsible disclosure process works, 
please check the JetBrains [Coordinated Disclosure Policy](https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/terms/coordinated-disclosure.html).
